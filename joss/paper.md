# Summary

What does the package do?

# Statement of Need

Why do we need this?

# Interactive Documentation

The package documentation allows users to compute fuel burn directly in the browser, without the need to install the package locally. This is achieved through the use of a [Pyodide](https://pyodide.org/en/stable/) Web Assembly Python kernel. The interactive documentation is available at [jetfuelburn.readthedocs.io](https://jetfuelburn.readthedocs.io).
