# Summary

`brightwebapp` is a Python package that provides a framework for building complex life-cycle assessment (LCA) and supply chain analysis applications that run in the browser using WebAssembly (WASM). It leverages the [Brightway](https://brightway.dev) LCA framework and the [Holoviz Panel](https://panel.holoviz.org) library to create interactive web applications. The package is designed as a template for developers to create their own LCA and supply chain analysis applications, with a focus on ease of use and flexibility.

# Statement of Need

The Brightway framework [@Mutel2017] is a powerful tool for life-cycle assessment and supply chain analysis, but it traditionally requires a local Python environment to run. On the one hand, this can be a barrier for users who are not familiar with Python or do not have the necessary environment set up. On the other hand, it means that web applications and interactive dashboards using Brightway as their computational core require a server backend to run the Brightway framework, which can be complex to set up and maintain. A recent example is the `carculator` application [@sacchi2022and], which assesses the environmental impact of automobiles.`brightwebapp` addresses this issue by allowing users to run LCA and supply chain analysis applications directly in their web browser, without the need for a local installation.

# Brightway and WebAssembly

# Interactive Web Application

The package documentation allows users to compute fuel burn directly in the browser, without the need to install the package locally. This is achieved through the use of a [Pyodide](https://pyodide.org/en/stable/) Web Assembly Python kernel. The interactive documentation is available at [jetfuelburn.readthedocs.io](https://jetfuelburn.readthedocs.io).
